# Tigergraph Import Schema
A database export contains the databaseâ€™s data, and optionally some types of metadata.This data can be subsequently imported in order to recreate the same database, in the original or in a different TigerGraph platform instance.
To import an exported database, ensure that the export files are from a database that was running the exact same version of TigerGraph as the database that you are importing into.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* TigerGraph - [Download & Install TigerGraph](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/current/getting-started/docker). Docker Instalation version 3.5.0

#### To start setting up the project and include h3 library in tigergraph system

Step 1: Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElectronBridge/Earth-Terrain-Data-Graph.git
```

Step 2: Copy src folder to Shared Folder which is shared with Docker Container:

```bash
cp -R Earth-Terrain-Data-Graph/src/* /<sharedfolder>
```

Step 3:  Connect to your container (via SSH or docker exec)

```bash
docker exec -it tigergraph /bin/bash
```

Step 4: Update and install Python and pip (python version > 3.0.0)

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3
apt-get install -y python3-pip
pip install h3
```

Step 5: Copy the static lib and headers from default installed path to tigergraph path.
```bash
#create folder for adding new lib in tigergraph
mkdir /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/app/3.5.0/dev/gdk/gsdk/include/thirdparty/h3 

#copy headers -- for example in ubuntu the default path is /usr/local/include
cp /usr/local/include/h3/h3api.h /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/app/3.5.0/dev/gdk/gsdk/include/thirdparty/h3/

#copy static lib -- for example in ubuntu the default path is /usr/local/lib
cp /usr/local/lib/libh3.a /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/app/3.5.0/dev/gdk/gsdk/lib/release/
```
Step 6: Add lib and header in tigergraph compiler path and save.
```bash
#add these lines  in "home/tigergraph/tigergraph/app/3.5.0/dev/gdk/MakeUdf"
LIBINCLUDE += -Igsdk/include/thirdparty/h3
LDFLAGS += -lh3
```

Step 7: Backup ExprFunction.hpp file and copy new ExprFunction.hpp file from exported data.
```bash
#add these lines  in "home/tigergraph/tigergraph/app/3.5.0/dev/gdk/MakeUdf"
cp /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/app/3.5.0/dev/gdk/gsql/src/QueryUdf/ExprFunctions.hpp /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/app/3.5.0/dev/gdk/gsql/src/QueryUdf/ExprFunctions.hppold
cp /home/tigergraph/mydata/ExprFunctions.hpp /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/app/3.5.0/dev/gdk/gsql/src/QueryUdf/ExprFunctions.hpp
```
Step 8: login as tigergraph user and Store the updated query UDF file
```bash
su tigergraph
gsql
GSQL > PUT ExprFunctions FROM "/home/tigergraph/tigergraph/app/3.5.0/dev/gdk/gsql/src/QueryUdf/ExprFunctions.hpp"
```
Step 9: Restart gadmin and import and install the exported data.
```bash
gadmin restart all
gsql
GSQL > IMPORT GRAPH ALL FROM "/home/tigergraph/mydata/exportgraphs/"
GSQL > INSTALL QUERY ALL 
```

## H3(Hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system) Functions port to Tigergraph

In an attempt to bring geo-spatial features to Tigergraph, we created [UDF functions](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gsql-ref/current/ddl-and-loading/add-token-function) for some of the functions from [Uber H3](https://github.com/uber/h3) Library.


### H3 Overview
H3 is a geospatial indexing system that partitions the world into hexagonal cells. H3 is open source under the Apache 2 license. The H3 Core Library implements the H3 grid system. It includes functions for converting from latitude and longitude coordinates to the containing H3 cell, finding the center of H3 cells, finding the boundary geometry of H3 cells, finding neighbors of H3 cells, and more. For info please visit https://h3geo.org/docs.


#### Highlights:
- H3 offers an easy API for indexing coordinates into a hexagonal grid, down to square meter resolution.

- Indexed data can be quickly joined across disparate datasets and aggregated at different levels of precision.

- H3 enables a range of algorithms and optimizations based
