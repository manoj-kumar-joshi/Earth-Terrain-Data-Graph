# Earth-Terrain-Data-Graph
Earth observation/geography data is available from Satellite and OpenStreetMap (OSM). 
We attempt to solve difficult terrain problems by combing Satellite/OSM data and TigerGraph.
With the combination of Tiger Graph and Geo-Spatial we can visualize geo-spatial use cases with respect to graph.
